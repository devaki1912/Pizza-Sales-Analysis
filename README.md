# Pizza Sales Analysis – Power BI Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using Power BI to understand business performance, customer behavior, and product demand. The dashboard provides insights into revenue, order patterns, and best- and worst-selling pizzas, helping the business make data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement

- The pizza business generates large volumes of sales data across different categories, sizes, and time periods. Without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to:

- Track overall revenue and order performance

- Identify peak and low sales periods

- Understand customer preferences

- Detect top-performing and underperforming products

- This project addresses these challenges by transforming raw sales data into meaningful insights using Power BI.
